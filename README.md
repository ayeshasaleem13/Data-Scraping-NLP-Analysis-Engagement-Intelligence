## Overview

This project scrapes and analyses a public Instagram account and a specific viral reel using **Instaloader**, processes 302 user comments through an **NLP pipeline** (TextBlob), detects posting patterns, classifies content pillars, computes virality scores, and exports everything into a structured Excel report and an HTML dashboard.

**Target Account:** [`@sozal_foods`](https://www.instagram.com/sozal_foods/) — Sofia and Urooj, Karachi, Pakistan  
**Target Reel:** [Brownie Recipe Reel](https://www.instagram.com/sozal_foods/reel/DNKo_RTIG4e/) (posted 10 Aug 2025)  
**Scrape Date:** 19 May 2026

## Pipeline Walkthrough

The notebook is split into **12 sequential cells**, each with a single responsibility:

### Cell 1 — Install & Import
Installs `instaloader`, `pandas`, `openpyxl`, `textblob`. Downloads NLTK corpora (`brown`, `punkt_tab`, `wordnet`, `averaged_perceptron_tagger_eng`, `conll2000`, `movie_reviews`).

### Cell 2 — Reel URL Input
Set `REEL_URL` here — the shortcode is auto-extracted from the URL tail.
```python
REEL_URL = "https://www.instagram.com/sozal_foods/reel/DNKo_RTIG4e/"
shortcode = REEL_URL.rstrip("/").split("/")[-1]
# → DNKo_RTIG4e
```

### Cell 3 — Scrape Reel Metrics
Uses `instaloader.Post.from_shortcode()` to fetch the reel object. Extracts views, likes, comments, caption, hashtags (via `re.findall(r'#\w+', caption)`), and date.

### Cell 4 — Account Metrics
Pulls `post.owner_profile` to retrieve account data in one call (no second API request). Includes a 4-second `time.sleep()` to respect rate limits.

### Cell 5 — Audience Authenticity
Calculates two quality signals:
- **F/F Ratio** = `followers / following` — healthy threshold: > 2
- **Engagement Rate** = `(likes + comments) / followers × 100` — good threshold: > 1%

### Cell 6 — Comment NLP Processing
Loads `sozal_foods_brownie_comments.csv`. Runs four detection passes:

| Pass | Method | Output Column |
|---|---|---|
| Sentiment | TextBlob polarity score | `sentiment` |
| Spam | Keyword matching | `spam_detection` |
| Questions | `'?' in text` | `question_detection` |
| Complaints | Keyword matching | `complaint_detection` |

### Cell 7 — Comment Analytics Dashboard (HTML)
Renders a styled HTML dashboard in Colab showing sentiment distribution bar, spam/question/complaint counts, top keywords, and professional insights.

### Cell 8 — Posting Pattern (Final Version)
Uses 29 manually confirmed post dates from @sozal_foods to compute:
- Best posting day and hour
- Average gap between posts
- Posts per week estimate

> **Note:** An earlier dynamic version of this cell failed due to a `NameError` — see [Errors & Fixes](#errors--fixes) below.

### Cell 9 — Content Pillar Detection
Classifies each post caption against four keyword-based pillar categories using `defaultdict` counters.

### Cell 10 — Velocity & Virality
```python
virality_score = (likes + comments * 2) / views * 100
like_to_view   = likes / views * 100
```
Verdicts: **Viral** > 5, **Strong** > 2, **Average** < 2.

### Cell 11 — Full HTML Analytics Report
Renders a premium dark-themed HTML dashboard inside Colab with sections for account overview, reel stats, sentiment analysis, posting timeline, hashtag cloud, and professional insights.

### Cell 12 — Excel Export
Exports all data objects to `sozal_foods_FULL_REPORT.xlsx` with 8 named sheets, then triggers download via `google.colab.files.download()`.

## Errors & Fixes

### ❌ Error 1 — GraphQL JSON Parse Warning

```
JSON Query to graphql/query: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0) [retrying; skip with ^C]
```

**Cause:** Instagram's CDN returned an empty body on the first GraphQL request (transient rate-limit soft block).  
**Fix:** Instaloader's built-in retry logic handled it automatically. No code change needed. Appeared in Cells 3 and 4.

---

### ❌ Error 2 — NameError: `owner` is not defined (Cell 8 — First Attempt)

```
⚠️ Outer error: name 'owner' is not defined
✅ Collected 0 posts
```

**Cause:** Cell 8 was run before Cell 4, so the `owner` variable (set by `post.owner_profile`) did not exist in the runtime.  
**Fix:** Redesigned Cell 8 as fully self-contained. Replaced live API post iteration with a hardcoded list of 29 manually confirmed post dates, eliminating the `owner` dependency entirely.

> **Attempts:** 2 — dynamic version failed → replaced with `Cell 8 (FINAL)` using manual dates.

---

### ❌ Error 3 — Instaloader Version Outdated

**Cause:** Installed Instaloader version had a known bug affecting the comment iterator on recent Instagram API changes.  
**Fix:** Added a dedicated upgrade cell before comment processing:

```python
!pip install --upgrade instaloader --quiet
print("✅ Instaloader upgraded")
```

---

### ❌ Error 4 — `post_count` Returns `None`

```
Post Count : None
```

**Cause:** `owner.mediacount` did not populate correctly for this account type in the Instaloader version used — a known field mapping issue in v3.x.  
**Fix:** Post count (141) was confirmed manually from the profile page and hardcoded into `account_data`.

## Results & Key Findings

| Metric | Value | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| Engagement Rate | 85.29% | ✅ Excellent (benchmark: 1–3%) |
| F/F Ratio | 377.2 : 1 | ✅ Healthy (organic growth) |
| Virality Score | 3.91 | ✅ Strong |
| Like-to-View Ratio | 3.85% | ✅ Above average |
| Positive Comments | 15.2% | ✅ Good |
| Negative Comments | 7.3% | ⚠️ Monitor |
| Spam Rate | 0.7% | ✅ Clean |
| Questions | 54 | 💡 Content opportunity |
| Complaints | 16 | ⚠️ Oil quantity concern |
| Best Posting Day | Sunday | — |
| Content Pillar | Recipe / How-to | 100% of posts |
| Top Comment Keywords | recipe, oil, brownies, use, can | — |

**Key insight:** 1.14M views from a 52K account = **22× reach multiplier**. The dominant complaint theme (oil quantity) is a direct content brief for a follow-up reel.

|---|---|
| `processed_instagram_comments.csv` | 302 comments with sentiment, spam, question, and complaint labels |

## How to Run

1. **Open the notebook** in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)

2. **Run Cell 1** to install dependencies

3. **Edit Cell 2** — paste any public Instagram reel URL:
   ```python
   REEL_URL = "https://www.instagram.com/your_target/reel/SHORTCODE/"
   ```

4. **Upload your comment CSV** when Cell 6 runs (must match the schema above), or skip Cell 6–7 if you don't have comment data

5. **Run all cells top to bottom** — Cell 12 will auto-download the Excel report

> ⚠️ Always run cells **in order** (1 → 12). Running Cell 8 before Cell 4 will raise a `NameError`. See [Errors & Fixes](#errors--fixes).

---

## Limitations

- **Shares, Saves, and Reposts** are owner-only metrics — not accessible without account authentication
- **Comment scraping via API** is restricted by Instagram for unauthenticated sessions; comments were pre-collected manually into CSV
- **`post_count`** may return `None` depending on Instaloader version and account type
- **Rate limiting:** Instagram may temporarily block requests — the 4-second sleep in Cell 4 and Instaloader's retry logic mitigate this but do not eliminate it
- **Sentiment accuracy** is limited for Urdu and mixed-language comments since TextBlob is trained on English corpora; Urdu text is often scored as Neutral by default
